For class we created a program that emulated the blink patterns of three types of fireflies! Below I've attached pictures of two of the leds, as well as a gif so that you could actually see the blinking of one of the leds.

The light below is emulating the pattern of the "Big Dipper" firefly!

Pro tip (from a not so pro): Your variables don't actually have any outcoome on your leds alone! In order for you to get your variables to work you should ALSO not forget to digitalWrite (or analogWrite) the commmands to your board.
