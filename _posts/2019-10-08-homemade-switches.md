I created two momentary switches on my embroidery sampler. The first switch is turned on by connecting two pieces of satin-stitched conductive thread, while the second is connected by pressing down a piece of conductive fabric. 
I've attatched some pictures below!

My alligator clip version has three LEDs because I initially decided to use three, but later only implemented one. 
If i had to give one tip to people completing this, it would be to make large patches or do some stitch that takes up a considerable amount of room when considering where you're going to press your conductive fabric. I have to press a bit hard and over all of my lazy daisy circuit breaks in order for me to get the brightness that I want from my LED, so I think it would be considerably harder to get any brightness if your conductive patch didn't have a lot of conductive thread to connect to.
