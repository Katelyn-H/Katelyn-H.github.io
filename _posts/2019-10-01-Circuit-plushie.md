This past week we were assigned the task of creating a light up plushie using conductive thread. The plushie would have two different kinds of inputs: a button and a switch. Both inputs need to be activated to see the plushie in its full glowing glory! 
Here is is a photo of the alligator clip prototyping stage. Well, actually its a recreation of the alligator clip prototyping stage done with the paper component replicas and the PICSart editing tool (used to create the lights).  I didn't realize we had to take a picture of this portion of our assignment until after my plushie was already finished. Go figure!

And here's a picture of the paper prototype:

And finally, here is the finished product:

I think I'll name it Wubzie! 

P.S 
If you ever try your hand at thsi project, I would suggest being extra careful when you sew with conductive thread. I found that it coiled more after I removed it to redo a bad section of sewing, and that just made things more difficult for me later.
