Hi ya'll! For my final post, I'd like to introduce you to the "Pomodro Pillow".   
The Pomdoro Pillow is a pillow that will have two functions meant to show time. Firstly, using the light sensor, when the pillow is placed against a window the sun or moon side of the pillow will glow indicating weather it is dark or bright outside (yes, I am well aware that if the window is open you can TELL whether it is bright or dark yourself, but wouldn't it be much more interesting to have a decorative pillow tell you?).
The second function means that the pillow will serve as an actual timer. When the alarm mode is on (aka the switch is on), pressing the button will add to a timer that will go off when its countdown is reached and will then play a beeping sound. To turn the beeping off and reset the timer, you must swtich the alarm mode off. Also, pressing the button when the alarm mode is off will play the C major scale and turn the lights on both the sun and moon side of the pillow on bright. 

For this project I used pink cotton fabric, blue cotton fabric, and piececs of shiny silvery and gold fabric to represent the moon and sun. Here are the initial cutouts for this.

What I intended for my final project to look like in my finalized paper prototype was sort of like this:

What it ended up looking lie was more like this :

Ahh, once again my terrible time management has struck. And woe! The unsuspecting victim was the Pomodoro pillow.  At first we were off to a good start:

But as the clock counted down I was not able to implement all of the designs elements I intially hoped for. One day I"ll probably make a Pomodoro pillow 2.0 as an homage to the first! I digress....

My alligator clip protootype went pretty swell. Everything I needed was on the board, so I was able to test most things out with minimal alligator clip action at first aside from the ones I needed to use for my button and switch. Here is the "night time" sensor working in action before I snapped the board's pieces off.

Still, I tested out all the parts of my project with alligator clips off board as well. I didn't have enough alligator clips to do this at once, so I instead split it into sections. This was the clip version of me testing the buttons.

 As for my three tips to my past self : 
 1) Please do not spend a day working on a simple timer code. Change the variable from int to long. Please!
 2) You will need a lot of conductibe thread! Make sure that you loop around the pins the necessary 5 times to secure them!   
 3)I When I was planning my project prototype, I didn't take into consideration that pins had different types, and that all wouldn't be capable of the analog capapbilities I needed. THinking back it would've saved me some time to map out my project with this in mind. 
 BONUS: IF you're facing a self-imposed time crisis past-self, maybe don't spend an hour measuring out the distance between whip stitches ?  
 
 If you've actually followed me from my first post on this class to this final one, I'd liek to thank you for following me on this journey. 
 
 And shoutout to future me, whose undoubtedly going to read this again at some point :p
