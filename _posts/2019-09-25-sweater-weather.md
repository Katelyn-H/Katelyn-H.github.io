 For class I created an assignment that gives tips on how to dress for certain temperatures! Below I've attached some possible outcomes of the program!( I especially like the last one!) 
 P.S 
 Dear Past Me, 
 Semicolons are your friends. Don't forget them. 
![The words Brrr! it's super cold out there, so you should bundle up. May I suggest layering clothes and wearing a scarf?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/1.PNG)
![The words Today's going to be chilly, so don't forget your jacket!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/2.PNG)
![The words Leave the jacket at home today--the weather's warm!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/3.PNG)
![The words  It's so hot outside! Try to opt for one of the following: 1. Loose-fitting flowy clothes 2. Tank tops and shorts 3. Light colored clothes ; they tend to keep you cooler!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/4.PNG) 
 ![The words Yikes! I don't know how humans can withstand temperatures like these!
 Instead of trying to dress for these extremes, can I recommend evacuating the planet?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/5.PNG)
