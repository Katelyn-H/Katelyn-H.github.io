So for our final project I decided to do a pillow clock! Basically, the pillow will use a light sesnor to change the LEDS according to the brightness outside, higlighting either the moon side if its dark or the sun side if its bright. In addition to this, using the button and switch on the pillow can enable it to behave like an actual timer! Pressing the button when the switch is off will just do a litle light show with the LEDs and play a short diddy, but pressing the button when the switch is on will add an hour to the timer, thus creating a countdown until the next time the alarm plays.
