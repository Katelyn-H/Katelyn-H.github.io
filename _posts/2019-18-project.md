So for our final project I decided to do a pillow clock! Basically, the pillow will use a light sesnor to change the LEDS according to the brightness outside, higlighting either the moon side if its dark or the sun side if its bright. In addition to this, using the button and switch on the pillow can enable it to behave like an actual timer! Pressing the button when the switch is off will just do a litle light show with the LEDs and play a short diddy, but pressing the button when the switch is on will add an hour to the timer, thus creating a countdown until the next time the alarm plays.  
For that reason, my project is aptly titled the "Pomodoro Pillow" (disclaimer: Iris came up with this very clever name, not I) 
Here is a picture of my paper prototype!

Few things to note about this prototype: 

1. Yes I am aware that I have used the wrong arduiono board in the picture. I was too far into completing it when I realized this however, so it's staying. 

2. All of the red lines represent the negative connection, and the blue lines represent the positive connection points.  It should be assumed that all of the conductive thread has been looped within the components the required five times. 

3. The final connection for the light sensor will be on the back outside of the pillow. 

4. Also the faded compnets represent you seeing it from the opposite side of where the components actually are.
