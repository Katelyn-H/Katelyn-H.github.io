So the assignment for today was to create a menu that changed based off of a random number selected by a custoemer. If the number was even, they got the regular menu. If not, the customer gets access to a *SECRET* menu. Pretty cool, huh?
This is the regular menu
!(Menu with choices of hamburger, hotdog, and salad labeled from 1 to 3 respectively)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/regular-menu.PNG]
And these are its options: 
!(The words Your hamburger is on its way)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/hamburger.PNG]
!(The words Hotdog, coming right at ya)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/hotdog.PNG]
!(The words Your salad is on its way)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/salad.PNG]
And this is what you see if you choose an unavailable option: 
!(The words You have chosen an invalid option. Please consult your menu and try again.)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/regular-oops.PNG]
 
 And here is the *secret* menu! 
 !(Menu with the choices of illuminati chicken wrap, dracula's dumplings, and big foot burrito, all labeled from 4 to 6 respectively)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/secret-menu.PNG]
 And here are its options: 
 !(The words illuminati chicken wrap, what an eye catching choice)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/sm-4.PNG]
 !(The words  Your Dracula's dumplings are on the way)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/sm-5.PNG]
 !(The words One big foot burrito, coming right up)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/master/img/sm-6.PNG]
 And lastly, here's what you see if you select an odd number but try to chose a number not offered on the secret menu.

  If I had to give one tip to my past self, it would be to organize my code in a better manner the first time around instead of cleaning it up later. It just makes it much easier to understand my program.
