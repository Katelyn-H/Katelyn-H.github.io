Earlier this week we were assigned the task of creating a light up plushie using conductive thread. The plushie would have two different kinds of inputs: a button and a switch. Both inputs need to be activated to see the plushie in its 'full glowing glory' (as I so artfully called it in my last post). 
So now the task was to create a program that would emulate the plushie button-switch behavior described above.   
Mines went pretty well. I was able to achieve all my desired outputs by playing around with the switch and button.

If I had to give one tip to past me (or present anyone whos's reading this and would like to try it), it would be to always declare intervals, no matter what they are, before introducing them to the rest of your code. I didn't do that, and was super confused and panicky about why it wouldn't work.
