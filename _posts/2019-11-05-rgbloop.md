Ghost busters!! 
 Anyway....
 
 For this assignment we were supposed to have our Arduiono board flash all of its red lights whenever it was both cold and dark. For this assignment I considered cold anything under 60 degrees.

Tips for past self:
#1. You need three alligator clips for the temperature sensor. So. That's why it was being weird the first time.  

Also, my temperature sensor started acting wonky after I returned to my room from the TA session and tried to get a solid reading. I'm not sure why this could be, because I had all the wires connected properly and my code hadn't changed.
