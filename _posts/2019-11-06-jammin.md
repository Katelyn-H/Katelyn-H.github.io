 For our most recent assignment we were supposed to have our Arduiono board play music whenever a switch was turned on on the board. I couldn't get mines to work, which is frustrating because I know this was meant to be a simple assignment. I initially tried to get a version of "Never Gonna Give You Up" from online, but it proved difficult to incorporate the code for the switch without receiving errors. So instead, I decided to just do the code for the "Doe a deer" scale song from the sound of music. Although it worked, I still couldn't get my switch to act as i had hoped. I'm not sure what went wrong, but I'll update my tip section when I find out :p
Tips for past self:
#1. You need three alligator clips for the temperature sensor. So. That's why it was being weird the first time.  

Also, my temperature sensor started acting wonky after I returned to my room from the TA session and tried to get a solid reading. I'm not sure why this could be, because I had all the wires connected properly and my code hadn't changed.
