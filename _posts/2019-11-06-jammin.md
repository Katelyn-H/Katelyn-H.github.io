 For our most recent assignment we were supposed to have our Arduiono board play music whenever a switch was turned on on the board. I couldn't get mines to work, which is frustrating because I know this was meant to be a simple assignment. I initially tried to get a version of "Never Gonna Give You Up" from online, but it proved difficult to incorporate the code for the switch without receiving errors. So instead, I decided to just do the code for the "Doe a deer" scale song from the sound of music. Although it worked, I still couldn't get my switch to act as i had hoped. I'm not sure what went wrong, but I'll update my tip section when I find out :p
 
 Edit: So. It turns out I needed to digitalWrite to my button in order for it to work. -_-
