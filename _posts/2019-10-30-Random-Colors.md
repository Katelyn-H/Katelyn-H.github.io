title: The Best Colors Are The Ones Randomly Selected By A Program

 Hey! I'm so happy because this is the first Wednesday deliverable I've finished before 11 pm! Yay me!  
 
 Anyway....
 
 For this assignment we were supposed to have our Arduino board flash the center light whenever a button is pressed. BUT THERE IS A CATCH: The color of the light must change randomly each time the button is pressed.
 Below is a gif of me demonstrating how my finished product works.

Tips for past self:
#1. Don't be afraid to scrap your work and start over. 
#2. Please save your non-working files so you can learn from them. 
#3. You couldn't get your lights to turn off at first because you had them set to digital 0 rather than analog 0. So that's why it would go from a multiflashing circus to a constant white light.
