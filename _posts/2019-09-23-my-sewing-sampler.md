  I finally finished my sewing sampler!! It feels as though I've been working on it forever, but I still had a ton of fun completing it. I'm pretty pleased with my finished work, and so was my mom (lol). Also: 
  Dear past me, 
  Please, for the love of all things dear to you, pull your thread all the way through when doing the back stitch. I used at least three spools trying to correct the mistakes I made, so if you love me (and you!), make sure to pull the thread all the way through after each stitch!
