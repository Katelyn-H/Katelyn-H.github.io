  If you've read my "About Me" , you should be a bit familiar with me already, but allow me to reiterate: My name is Katelyn Harris. I’m a sophomore at Williams College, an Alabama native, and a prospective American Studies major. Needle and thread are practically woven into the cultural roots of my hometown of Alberta, Alabama. Countless of my family members are gifted needleworkers——my paternal Grandmother is a quilter and my mother is a talented seamstress. On one hand, I’m taking Electronic Textiles to gain a better appreciation for sewing, a skill that so many women back home have harnessed both for the sake of utility as well for a creative outlet. On the other hand, I’ve always loved tinkering with tech, so this course will be the best of both worlds!
  
   Although I have grown up around many women who were gifted seamstresses, my own experience with sewing has been very limited. In that past I have sewn some patches onto the JROTC uniforms of cadets in my unit, fixed plushies with ladder-stitching, and sewn up holes on some of my older and more worn-out t-shirts.   
  For reference, this is the kind of patch I would add to JROTC uniforms.

  I have no prior experience with programming, but I am a bit acquainted with HTML. In middle school my friend and I would edit our profiles on IMVU using HTML, and in high school I took an online course for Web Design, which showed me how to create webpages with WYSIWYG programs (What You See Is What You Get). Unfortunately, I cannot show my IMVU profile because my account was disabled due to inactivity, *but* I can show a snapshot of the terrible (absolutely *dreadful* really, in terms of visual appeal) website I created back in High School.

The first thing about this film that caught my attention was the title, which sounded like something from a children’s adventure story'.](https://github.com/Katelyn-H/Katelyn-H.github.io/blob/master/img/Capture.PNG?raw=true) 
###### Given the quality of the above webpage, I think its safe to say it can only go up from here folks.  


Overall, I hope to come out of this class with some semblance of competence with a needle and thread, as well as a basic understanding of programing. I'm excited to join you all for this journey!

P.S 
Here comes my obligatory random fact: I can quote all of episode 60 of Teen Titans (2003) verbatim (hence the word *heroes* in my post title). Also I own a horse.
