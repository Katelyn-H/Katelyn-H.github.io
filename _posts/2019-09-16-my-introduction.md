  If you've read my "About Me" , you should be a bit familiar with me already, but allow me to reiterate: My name is Katelyn Harris. I’m a sophomore at Williams College, an Alabama native, and a prospective American Studies major. Needle and thread are practically woven into the cultural roots of my hometown of Alberta, Alabama. Countless of my family members are gifted needleworkers——my paternal Grandmother is a quilter and my mother is a talented seamstress. On one hand, I’m taking Electronic Textiles to gain a better appreciation for sewing, a skill that so many women back home have harnessed both for the sake of utility as well for a creative outlet. On the other hand, I’ve always loved tinkering with tech, so this course will be the best of both worlds!
  
   Although I have grown up around many women who are gifted seamstresses, my own experience with sewing has been very limited. In that past I have sewn some patches onto the JROTC uniforms of cadets in my unit, fixed plushies with ladder-stitching, and sewn up holes on some of my older and more worn-out t-shirts.   
  For reference, this is the kind of patch I would add to JROTC uniforms.
