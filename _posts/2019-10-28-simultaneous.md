For the last class assignment, we were tasked with creating three different codes for LEDs that emulated the blinking patterns of different fireflies. For this class, we were told to merge them all into one code! 
Below is a gif of my product

I'm really pleased with the outcome! If I had to give one tip to my past self, it would be to watch the placement of my opening and closing brackets, particularly when setting up an if statement behind a series of else if statements. I had a problem with getting the synchronous LED to stop flashing, and this was because I had put a bracket before my final if statement that was meant to reset the process. This bracket placement issue was also one of the problems I ran into when completing the Big Dipper code, so I'll (or rather 'we'll', since I'm addressing past me) be sure to look out for that mistake in the future.
