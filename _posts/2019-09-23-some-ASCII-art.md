 I found this cool Snoopy ASCII art on the web at [this website]( https://www.oocities.org/spunk1111/peanuts.htm) It was made by Joan Stark, also known as GEOcities user Spunk1111.
 I used a program named atom to make a c file that showed off the Snoopy art. Atom is essentially a compiler that basically turns certain programming language into C-programming language. This basically makes it a translator that tells the computer what I want it to do. Thanks atom for telling it to make this Snoopy art! 
 ```c 
 #include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
     printf("            __...._\n");
     printf("         .'`     .-`.\n");
     printf("        /       //``\\_\n");
     printf("       /  .-. .'\\_.'/    `'.\n");
     printf("       | /   \  /'-'`        \ \n");
     printf("       | \   / |             ;)\n");
     printf("       \  '-'  |            .' \n");
     printf("        '-.,_  |      __..-'\n");
     printf("  _'=,_______'-,\__.-'\n");
     printf("  .=[_______.-'(___(   _\n");
     printf("             /   .--.     )\n");
     printf("            /   /   -\-.-'\n");
     printf("           / \  |    ~;\n");
     printf("          ;-'  _|     |\n");
     printf(" jgs  ___.|   `       |\n");
     printf("     `'---'`---------'\n");
     return 0;
 }
 ```
