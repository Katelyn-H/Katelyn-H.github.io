 For our most recent assignment we were supposed to hook our vibe board up to our arduino board. Yes, the vibe board is its real name. Yes, I did mentally scream "vibe check" every time the professor said it. Anyway, the vibe board was supposed to play our name when the board circuit was open (when the button wasn't pressed) and then it would play SOS when the circuit was closed (when the button was pressed). Knowing that I had issues with my button last time (see my previous post), I went to office hours and learned that my problems all boiled down to I needed to digitalWrite to my button. Go figure. 
 So my tip to my past self would be to always digitalWrite to the button.
