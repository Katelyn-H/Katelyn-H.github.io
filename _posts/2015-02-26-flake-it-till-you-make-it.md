If you've read my about me, you should be a bit familiar with me already, but allow me to reiterate: My name is Katelyn Harris. I’m a sophomore at Williams College, an Alabama native, and a prospective American Studies major. Needle and thread are practically woven into the cultural roots of my hometown of Alberta, Alabama. Countless of my family members are gifter sewers, but the most precious to me are my paternal Grandmother, who is a quilter, and my mother, who has been a seamstress for most of ehr life. On one hand, I’m taking Electronic Textiles to gain a better appreciation for sewing, a skill that so many back home have used as a means for creative self-expression. On the other hand, I’ve always loved tinkering with tech, so this course will be the best of both worlds!
