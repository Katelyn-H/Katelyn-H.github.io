We were tasked with creating a program that mimicked a certain kind of LED behavior. On every tenth loop progarm would loop Red 3 times,  then green 3 times, then blue three times. I couldn't get my program to work, which is unfortunate. 
It looks fine if you don't extend the run time past 100.

If you extend it past 100, the pattern should continue as above. But instead of that,
*I would see this:*

RED 
RED 
RED
GREEN 
GREEN 
GREEN 
BLUE 
BLUE 
BLUE 
RED 
RED  
RED 
BLUE 
BLUE 
BLUE 
GREEN 
GREEN 
GREEN 
RED 
RED 
RED 
GREEN 
GREEN 
GREEN 
and so on.... 

I guess my tip would be to myself then would be to go to office hours!
