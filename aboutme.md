Hi, my name is Katelyn Harris. I’m a sophomore at Williams College, an Alabama native, and a prospective American Studies major. Needle and thread are practically sewn into the cultural roots of my hometown—countless of my family members are quilters. On one hand, I’m taking Electronic Textiles to gain a better appreciation for sewing, a skill so many back home have used as a means of self-expression. On the other hand, I’ve always loved tinkering with tech, so this course will be the best of both worlds!


To see some of the **beautiful** quilting done by my grandmother, feel free to visit [this site!](http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/artist/addie-pearl-nicholson).
